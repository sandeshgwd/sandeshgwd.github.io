		<h2>Autonomous delivery system</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Coolio</strong>
		<p>I co-founded 'Coolio', an autonomous in-Airport delivery system for travelers in 2016 as a side gig. Airports see high volume of passengers, food courts spread across; however people have restricted options around the vicinity of the gates. Our goal was to provide travellers and staff access to whatever they want and delivered to their gate.<br>
		I worked on building the platform and developed 5 different prototypes from lazer cut options to 3D modelling. Also implemented a control architecture with hierarchical planner for navigation. This helped the robot maneuver through tight spaces, crowded environment and also detect small obstacles. The videos will give more insight to this.</p>

		<h2>Thesis</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Autonomous Robotic Landmine Detection, Mapping and Avoidance</strong>
		<p>The thesis put forth the socially challenging issue of Landmine detection and deals with a solution strategy for localization of metals using non-linear optimization, usage of machine learning radial basis support vector machine classifier to distinguish between metal samples including surrogate mines and avoidance of the mines using potential field approach.<br>
		Designed C++ & ROS multi-process based system for the approach.<br>
		Interfaced multiple sensors like LIDAR, camera, infrared sensors and odometry for motion/path planning and worked with multiple robot – youBot, PR2 and single-board odroid.<br>
		Upgraded Labo3a (AAI) diff. drive robot to ROS framework platform, incorporated SLAM gmapping and autonomous navigation using A* algorithm. Worked on low-level device drivers and RTAI kernel patch<br>
		Also worked with MATLAB, CAD design and, git for code maintenance and review.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Improvised on the Metal detector platform of Humanitarian Robotics and Automation 2014 Challenge (HRATC) with classification - machine learning techniques, optimization - estimation techniques and navigation strategies for surrogate landmine identification and its avoidance.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li><strong>Design of a Preemptive and Cooperative Real-time Operating System</strong>
		<br>
		<p>Implemented selectable cooperative or preemptive RTOS in Embedded C. Designed hardware using PIC33FJ128MC802 micro-controller. Priority based task scheduled and switching carried with support for semaphores, yielding and system timers. Controller functions involved task scheduler based on priorities and kernel functions like yield, sleep, wait and signal for semaphore, and destroyProcess for resource handling.
